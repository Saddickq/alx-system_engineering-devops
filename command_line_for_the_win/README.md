**steps i followed to use the SFTP command-line tool**

2. After taking the screenshot i went to where it was located on my computer and copied the file path.

3. Back to the SFTP i navigated to the command_line_for_the_win directory on the project, then i used the used the command `put <file_path_to_screenshot>` ENTER.
4. Once this step was completed, i went to my webterm (to the projects directory)and push to github.
